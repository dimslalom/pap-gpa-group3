        "# Evaluation and Conclusion\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Explanation of Preprocessing Steps**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Handling Missing Values**:\n",
        "   We identified columns that contained missing values and decided to handle them using the most appropriate method for each case:\n",
        "   - For columns critical to the analysis, such as `Crm Cd Desc` (Crime Code Description) and `Vict Age` (Victim Age), we removed rows that contained missing values. This decision was based on the importance of these columns for crime type prediction; imputing these values could introduce bias or noise into the dataset.\n",
        "   - Other columns with missing values that were deemed irrelevant to the crime type prediction task were dropped from the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Removing Irrelevant Data**:\n",
        "   Certain columns, such as unique identifiers (`DR_NO`) or redundant columns, were removed from the dataset. These columns were not expected to contribute to the prediction of crime types and were removed to streamline the dataset and improve model performance by reducing noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Handling Duplicates**:\n",
        "   We checked for duplicate entries in the dataset. Duplicate rows, if present, were removed to avoid redundancy and ensure the integrity of the data. This step helps prevent overrepresentation of certain data points, which could skew model predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Handling Outliers**:\n",
        "   Outliers were identified in numeric columns such as `Vict Age` (Victim Age). We analyzed the distribution of these variables and decided to remove outliers to improve the overall quality of the dataset. Removing outliers helps ensure that the machine learning models are not disproportionately influenced by extreme values that do not reflect typical crime occurrences.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Date and Time Transformation**:\n",
        "   The `Date Occ` (Date of Occurrence) and `Time Occ` (Time of Occurrence) columns were transformed to extract useful features. We converted these columns into a usable datetime format and created additional features such as `Hour`, `Day of the Week`, and `Month`. This allowed us to capture temporal patterns in crime occurrences, such as the times or days when crimes are more likely to happen.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Categorical Encoding**:\n",
        "   Categorical variables, such as `Vict Sex` (Victim's Gender), were encoded using one-hot encoding. This transformation allowed us to represent categorical data numerically, which is essential for machine learning models that require numerical inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Normalization and Standardization**:\n",
        "   Numerical columns like `Vict Age` were normalized to ensure that all features are on a similar scale. This step helps improve the performance of machine learning models by preventing features with larger ranges from dominating the training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Final Dataset Preparation**:\n",
        "   After cleaning, transforming, and encoding the data, the final dataset was saved in a CSV format. This dataset is now free from missing values, irrelevant columns, duplicates, and outliers, and it is ready for use in predictive modeling.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Summary of Key Patterns from Data Exploration**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class Distribution**: Certain crime types, such as \"Battery\" and \"Theft,\" are dominant in the dataset. This indicates a class imbalance that may need to be addressed in later modeling steps.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Time-based Patterns**: Crimes are more frequent during late evening hours, particularly between 6 PM to 11 PM, with a noticeable decline during early morning hours. This suggests that the time of day is a critical factor in crime occurrence.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Day of the Week**: There is a significant increase in crimes during weekends, especially on Saturdays. This implies that certain days are more crime-prone than others.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Geospatial Distribution**: The geographical analysis reveals that crimes tend to cluster in certain areas, indicating that some zones are more prone to criminal activity. These geographical zones could provide strong predictive power for crime types.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Victim's Age**: The distribution of victim ages shows a concentration around young to middle-aged adults, with some outliers at older ages. This suggests that age might also play a role in predicting certain types of crimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Relevant Features for Predicting Crime Types**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Time-related Features**: The hour of the day, day of the week, and month are crucial predictors. Different types of crimes show distinct patterns during specific times, days, and months.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Geographical Zones**: Geographic location is a strong predictor, as crimes are not uniformly distributed across the city. The zones derived from clustering the location data highlight areas that are more prone to certain crime types.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Victim’s Demographics**: Attributes such as the victim’s age and gender could help predict the type of crime, given that certain demographics are more commonly targeted in particular types of crimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Holiday Indicator**: Whether or not the crime occurred on a holiday could be relevant, as crime patterns tend to shift during special occasions and holidays.\n",
